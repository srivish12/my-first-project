Part 1: Compare the markdown code to the preview: 

The # character in Markdown creates headings. A single # creates the largest heading (h1), two ## create a slightly smaller heading (h2) and so on.
Adding a third # to the Credits heading made the headings smaller (h3).
Other features written in the provided markdown include:
Lists created with numbers (e.g., 1.) or dashes (-).
Links written using the syntax [Link text](URL).
The side preview updates automatically as you type.
What to include in a README
A README.md file should be clear, concise and organised. It helps others (and even yourself) understand what the project is, what it does, and how to use it. At a high level, you should include:

The project title.
A brief description of what the project does and its purpose.
A list of key features or functionality in your project.
Instructions on how to view or use the project.
Credits for anyone who contributed to the project, or resources you used.
Markdown
README files are written in Markdown, a simple, lightweight coding language for formatting text. Markdown is widely used because it is easy to learn and write, looks clean and professional, and works across many platforms including GitHub and VS Code.

Here's a quick look at some basic Markdown syntax:

Markdown Syntax	Result
# Heading	Large heading (H1)
## Subheading	Smaller heading (H2)
- Bullet list item	Creates a bullet list
1. Numbered list item	Creates a numbered list
[Link Text](https://example.com)	Creates a link
**Bold text**	Bold text
<!-- Comment -->	Adds a comment (not shown in output)
