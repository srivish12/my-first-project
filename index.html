	      <h3>Modern-day Perahera </h3>

	<div class="text-box " id="text-center" >  
	  <p>
		
The Festival of Tooth (The Kandy Esala Perahera) begins with “Kap Situweema ” Kap chanting ceremony, in which a sanctified young jackfruit tree is cut and planted on the premises of each of the four Devalayas (Temples of Gods) dedicated to the four guardians.  Gods Natha, Vishnu, Katharagama and the goddess Pattini. Traditionally, it was meant to shower blessings on the King and the people.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>
After “The Kap Situweema” the Esala Perahera procession takes place within the premises of four Devalayas for five nights. Gold armaments (Ran Auyddha) are carried around each of the temples of the Gods, accompanied by flag bearers, drummers, and traditional music performers.
	  </p>

	  <br>
	  <br>

	  <p>
On the sixth night, four Devayas joined with the Temple of Tooth to perform The Kumbal Perahera (The Kumbal Procession). Ornaments and clothes are mostly decorated with white colour. This Kumbal Procession is conducted for five consecutive nights before the commencement of the Randoli Procession.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>
It is believed that the first Kumbal perahera can drive away Evil Spirits and ill will from newborns and infants.
	  </p>

	  <br>
	  <br>

	  <p>
Thereafter Randoli Procession parades the streets for another five nights. Golden armaments and golden costumes are used in this procession. The last Randoli Procession, which is held on the fifth night, is called the Grand Randoli Procession. It is the most colourful and glamorous procession of this festival, and all the performers are in their full costumes on that day.

On the same day, early morning, after the street performances, part of the procession goes to the “ Water cutting ceremony” at the River Mahaweli, a few miles away from Kandy city.
The Day perahara (The Day Procession) is conducted to mark the Water cutting ceremony on the following day. After doing the Day Procession, the lay custodian of the Sacred Tooth Relic informs the Ruler of the country that they have successfully conducted the Festival of Tooth.

      <h3>Glamour of the Pageant </h3>
	  <div class="text-box "id="text-center">

This procession is held to pay homage to the Sacred Tooth Relic of Lord Buddha. Therefore, the Temple of the Tooth Perahara goes in front of all the Devala(God’s Temples) processions.
	  </p>
	  <p>
King Keerthi Sri Megawarna, who pledged that the relic must be carried around the city once a year, and this tradition has been continuously followed by a succession of many ruling Kings, prime ministers, and presidents of Sri Lanka. So far, 1714  processions have been conducted since it was first started. 
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  
	  <p>
Before starting the festival, the Tooth relic casket is carried towards the ceremonial tusker from the palace under much veneration, till it is placed on the awaiting tusker. Once it is securely placed on the tusker, cannonball fire announces to the public that the tusker has come out of the Temple of Tooth with the Tooth relic to join the procession.
	  </p>
	  <img src="assets\images\whip masters.jpg" width="70%" alt="Whip-masters">

    <p class="text-white picture-disc">
					Whip-masters
				</p>
	  <p>
Walking up front with the soul of thundering whips piercing through the skies are the whip crackers announcing that the procession has commenced, and these whip Masters are tasked with clearing the way for the sacred Tooth relic casket and the King. 
Then the fireball performers come and illustrate how lightning comes with the rain. Flag bearers and sword bearers come before the first elephant(leading Elephant) walks with "Perumane Rala" on his back. Officially, no elephant is permitted to parade before him.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  
	  <p>
Official music groups, such as trumpet players, flutists, various types of traditional drummers, and cultural dancers, perform along the streets with elephants. School children are also given the chance to show their talents in this festival.
		<p>
			<br>	
Burnt coconut shells (Coppara Torches) are lighting up the streets of Kandy to welcome this grand procession.

		<br>
		<p>
"Wess" dancing groups who shall be dancing in great respect to welcome the Royal troops of tuskers who shall be carrying the tooth relic casket. The royal tasker who carries the Tooth relic only walks on the white carpet to respect the Tooth relic.
In ancient times, it was the ruling King who would parade the streets in the Perahara, but now it is the "Diya Wadana Nilame" the lay custodian of the sacred Tooth relic of Lord Buddha, who will resemble the King in the modern day Perahara. He walks behind the Royal tusker, who carries the tooth relic with his group of officials.
		</p>

		<Br>		
		<p>
The procession conducted by Natha God’s Temple (Natha Dewala Perahara) is followed by the Temple of the Tooth’s procession. Saffron colour is attributed to the God Natha. Therefore, performers wear a saffron-coloured dress in this procession.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
The procession belongs to the God Vishnu’s Temple, followed by the God Natha’s procession. Their theme is blue.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
Then the God Katharagama's Temple procession shows respect to the sacred Tooth Relic after the God Vishnu's procession.  Their theme is red.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
 Goddess Paththini's Temple performs the last procession. They use yellow colour as their theme.

					<h3> History of the Senkadagala Esala Perahara</h3>
				<br>
				<p>
				The secred Tooth Relik is revered and worshipped as the living Buddha himself. Thus, different types of rituals associated with its worship, the Kandy Esala Perahara is considered the foremost among all such possessions in the nation. According to Buddhist literature Festival of the Tooth is held to honour the Lord Buddha.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				Ancient scripts and history unveil that the history of this event goes back to 328 AD during the reign of King Kithsiri Mewan.
				</p>
				<br>
				<P>
				The sacred tooth Ralic was brought from India and placed in the Isurumuniya Viharaya(Temple), and the king kithsiri Mewan commenced the worship of the sacred tooth relic with Dalada perahara (Dalada Procession).
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				The procession was of such a pageantry and such beauty that King Kithsiri Mewan continued the Perahara every year during the time of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				Thereafter, regardless of how the king ascended the throne or how his coronation took place, every king or queen continued this event every year to get blessings of the sacred tooth Relic and the rains and fertility to the country. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				Successive Kings of Polonnaruwa , Dambadeniya, Kurunegala ,Gampola ,Kotte,Senkadagala(Kandy)  kingdoms conducted the Perahara according to the great traditions that had been established before them.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				Most of the customs and rituals were taken from "Dalada Siritha," which is an old book written during the reign of  King Parakramabahu IV.  These customs and rites were followed exactly the same way as in the past.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				During the Senkadagala kingdom,  King Wimaladharmasooriya made a great effort to bring the sacred tooth Relic to Senkadagala, and placed it in a specially constructed building inside the king's Palace.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				Until the year 1815 Senkadagala Kingdom (Sri Lankan Kingdom) passed into the control of British colonists, the Festival of Tooth was conducted with royal honor and devotion each year. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				During the period of colonists, Diyawadana Nilame (lay custodian of the Tooth Relic) was tasked with conducting the annual Esala Perahara according to the ancient traditions.
